# System Architecture Overview
## Frete Inteligente - Intelligent Freight Management System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Architecture Type:** Cloud-Native Microservices  

## Architecture Summary

The Frete Inteligente system follows a modern cloud-native microservices architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The system is built on containerized services orchestrated using Kubernetes, with a focus on event-driven communication and real-time data processing.

## High-Level Architecture Components

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Web Application**: React.js with TypeScript for responsive admin dashboard
- **Mobile Applications**: React Native for iOS and Android driver/customer apps
- **API Gateway**: Kong/AWS API Gateway for request routing and authentication
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX/AWS ALB for traffic distribution

### 2. Application Layer (Microservices)
- **Route Optimization Service**: Python/TensorFlow for ML-based route planning
- **Fleet Management Service**: Node.js/Express for vehicle tracking and management
- **Load Planning Service**: Java/Spring Boot for cargo optimization algorithms
- **Notification Service**: Node.js for real-time alerts and communications
- **User Management Service**: Java/Spring Security for authentication and authorization
- **Integration Service**: Node.js for third-party API integrations

### 3. Data Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL cluster for transactional data
- **Cache Layer**: Redis cluster for session management and frequent queries
- **Time Series DB**: InfluxDB for IoT sensor data and tracking information
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for advanced search and analytics
- **File Storage**: AWS S3/Azure Blob for documents and media files

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE)
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and alerting
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Microservices Pattern
- **Service Decomposition**: Business capability-based service boundaries
- **Data Isolation**: Each service owns its data and database
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Independent Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines for each service

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Sourcing**: Audit trail and state reconstruction capabilities
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write operations optimization
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Kafka-based event streaming for loose coupling
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management across services

### Cloud-Native Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience against service failures
- **Bulkhead**: Isolation of resources and failure containment
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
- **Configuration Management**: Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- **Languages**: Python (ML services), Java (core business logic), Node.js (APIs)
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Express.js, FastAPI
- **ML/AI**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Apache Spark
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch

### Frontend Applications
- **Web**: React.js, TypeScript, Material-UI/Ant Design
- **Mobile**: React Native, Redux, React Navigation
- **Real-time**: WebSocket, Server-Sent Events
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL, Google Maps SDK

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm charts
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI/Jenkins, ArgoCD for GitOps
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS/Azure/GCP (multi-cloud ready)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, AWS CDK

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Identity Provider**: OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect (Auth0/Cognito)
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with short expiration
- **Role-Based Access**: Fine-grained permissions per service
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP/SMS for privileged accounts

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for database and storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Data Masking**: PII protection in non-production environments
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

### Network Security
- **Network Isolation**: Private subnets and security groups
- **Web Application Firewall**: Protection against common attacks
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloud-native DDoS mitigation
- **Certificate Management**: Automated SSL/TLS certificate rotation

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching with Redis and CDN
- **Load Balancing**: Geographic and application-layer load distribution

### Performance Optimization
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing strategy and query optimization
- **API Optimization**: GraphQL for efficient data fetching
- **Image Optimization**: CDN with automatic compression
- **Mobile Optimization**: Offline-first architecture with sync

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Business and technical KPIs via Prometheus
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Logging**: Centralized structured logging with ELK
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical issues

### Business Intelligence

- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake/BigQuery for historical analysis
- **ETL Pipelines**: Apache Airflow for data processing
- **Machine Learning**: MLflow for model lifecycle management

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

### Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Multi-region data synchronization
- **Application Backups**: Container image and configuration versioning
- **Documentation Backups**: Version-controlled system documentation

### High Availability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Distributed across availability zones
